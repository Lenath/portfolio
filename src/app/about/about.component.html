            Shortly about me: I have graduated Computer Studies at University of Economics in Cracow. 
            Then I left to work in Ireland as General Operative in CWS boco. 
            This experience has improved my language and management skills. 
            Now I'm back, actively learning new Frontend technologies, 
            gaining my Master degree in Marketing and logistics at Jagiellonian University 
            and what most important - looking for new opportunities.
          </p>

            Out of my professional bio, I am an active PS4 gamer (including VR) 
            and I am really interested in Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, IoT and AI. 
            Besides I am also cat owner. Meow!
