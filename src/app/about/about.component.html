            <b>My name is Klaudia and I am 26 yo developer based in Krak√≥w,

            Shortly about me: I have graduated Computer Studies at the Krakow University of Economics, and Management fields at Jagiellonian University. 
            Between the first and second degrees, I decided to have a gap year and I moved to Ireland to get experience at work. I was working in Dublin city as a General Operative in the CWS boco company. 
            This experience has improved my language, logistics, and management skills. 
            At the same time, I was actively learning Frontend technologies and looking for new opportunities in Krakow. <br>
            <b>Over 2 years ago I started my IT adventure</b> at ABB company and joined ABB Ability Team, which is creating innovative cloud solutions for the Clients and supporting them in the Digital Transformation.

            and I am really interested in Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, IoT and AI.
